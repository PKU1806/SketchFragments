# file/folder introduction
log&pcap:sth generated by certain tools

p4src:the p4 code implement

monitor.py: switch the sketches 

p4app.json : topology description and some network setting

routing-controller.py : under the l3 net , we use this to fill our router table and other table. `initializer`:run it after mininet starts

simple_receiver:implemented using scapy, dismantle the packet and show info

simple_sender: send udp/tcp packet (default: 1  udp  packet),usage:using -h to see

test.py:get the CPU packet from a specific switch 

visor.py:list the sketch's value of switches

# the testing method
## basic step 
1. get into the ../switch folder
2. activate tmux and create duplicate windows
3. window A as the mininet console ,type " sudo p4run " to evoke the mininet
4. when the mininet_env is established, type "python routing-controller.py"  to set the tables in window B

## send file & receive file & listening switch
5. in window C,type "mx h1" and type "python simple_sender.py -h" to send packet from h1 and get help
6. in window D,type "mx h4" and type "python simple_receiver.py" to listen from a eth port
7. in window B (after mini-step4),type "mx s7" ,and "python test.py -h" to minitor control plane of s7 (only s7's cpu-monitor is activated,so avoid using other switches)
